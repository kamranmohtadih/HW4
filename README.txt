1. Access https://github.com/kamranmohtadih/HW4 for the codes and diagrams
2. Run FrozenLake.py and Forest.py to generate respective graphs for each problem.
3. In each of those files tune the hyper parameters of maximum iteration, epsilon, gamma, ... in the global parameters section (below line 11 and 9 respectively)
5. In the images folder you can find all generated images for frozen lake
6. In forest folder you can find all images for forest experiment
7. I have used gym and mdptoolbox libraries for these experiments. They should be added if not available to the environment.
